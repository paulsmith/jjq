 Highest Impact

  - Add jjq retry <failed-id> [--rev <revset>] [--rebase]:
      - Automates the common recovery loop: find failed item → rebase onto trunk → requeue.
      - This would have removed most of the manual work from failures 3, 4, and 6.
  - Add jjq run --all --continue-on-failure (or make it default, with --stop-on-failure):
      - In my run, --all stopped at first failure, which slowed queue draining.
      - Pick one semantics and make docs/man/spec all match it.
  - Add jjq doctor:
      - Validates trunk bookmark, check command, lock state, and workspace preconditions.
      - Catches common config errors before queue items fail.

  Check Command / Validation UX

  - Add jjq check [--rev <revset>]:
      - Runs configured check command once outside queue processing to verify it’s sane.
      - Would have caught my GOCACHE path problem before queue item 1 failed.
  - Improve check failure diagnostics:
      - Parse and classify known setup errors (env/path/tooling) and print “likely config
        issue” vs “code issue”.
  - Document check runtime environment clearly:
      - Exact cwd, shell, env inheritance, and path requirements (absolute vs relative).

  Status / Observability

  - Make status show richer metadata for queue+failed items:
      - candidate change ID, candidate commit ID, trunk-at-queue-time, and failed workspace
        path.
  - Add jjq status --json:
      - Essential for agent orchestration and reliable automation.
  - Add jjq show <id>:
      - Single-item deep view (history, failure reason, recovery hints).

  Docs / Onboarding

  - Add jjq init wizard:
      - Sets trunk_bookmark, check_command, runs jjq check, and writes a starter config.
  - Add an “Agent/Multi-workspace cookbook” section:
      - Concrete flow for jj workspace add, jjq push, conflict recovery, and re-queue
        patterns.
  - Tighten error hints:
      - Every failure should include the next exact command(s), not just general guidance.

  If I had to pick just 3 to build first: retry, doctor/check, and richer status (+
  --json).
