.SH DESCRIPTION
.B jjq
is a local merge queue for
.BR jj (1)
(Jujutsu VCS).
It queues revisions for merging to a trunk bookmark, processes them in
FIFO order, and gates each merge on a configurable check command.
This prevents the \(lqworks on my branch\(rq problem where changes pass
checks individually but fail when combined with concurrent work.
.PP
.B jjq
stores all state inside the jj repository using bookmarks and an
isolated metadata branch.
No external database or service is required.
.SH COMMANDS
.SS init \fR[\fB\-\-trunk \fIbookmark\fR] [\fB\-\-check \fIcommand\fR]
Initialize jjq in the current repository.
Sets up the metadata branch and configures the trunk bookmark and check
command.
.PP
With
.B \-\-trunk
and
.B \-\-check
flags, runs non\-interactively.
Without flags, prompts for each value.
The trunk bookmark defaults to
.B main
if that bookmark exists, or
.B master
as a fallback.
.PP
If stdin is not a terminal and required flags are missing, exits with
an error.
.PP
Refuses to run if jjq is already initialized.
Use
.B jjq config
to change settings after initialization.
.PP
After configuration, runs
.B jjq doctor
to validate the setup.
.SS push \fIrevset\fR
Queue a revision for merging to trunk.
The revset must resolve to exactly one revision.
.PP
Before queuing,
.B jjq
creates a temporary merge commit between the trunk and the candidate to
check for textual conflicts.
If conflicts are detected, the push is rejected with exit code 1.
.PP
Push is idempotent for the same change ID: if the change is already
queued or failed, the stale entry is cleared and the revision is
re\-queued.
However, if the same change ID is already queued at a different commit
ID (i.e., the revision has been amended), the push is rejected with
exit code 10.
.PP
.RS
.nf
jjq push @              # queue the working copy
jjq push feat\-xyz@      # queue a workspace's working copy
jjq push abc123         # queue by change ID
.fi
.RE
.SS run \fR[\fB\-\-all\fR]
Process the next queued item.
Creates a temporary jj workspace with two parents (trunk and candidate),
then runs the configured check command inside it.
.PP
On success, the trunk bookmark advances to the merge commit and the
temporary workspace is cleaned up.
.PP
On failure (conflicts or check command failure), the item moves to the
failed list.
The temporary workspace is preserved for debugging.
.PP
If the trunk bookmark moves during processing (e.g., another runner
advanced it), the run aborts and instructs the user to retry.
.PP
With
.BR \-\-all ,
processes items in a loop until the queue is empty or an item fails.
Reports the count of successes and failures.
.PP
Returns 0 if at least one item was processed successfully (or the queue
was empty).
Returns 1 if any item failed.
.SS check \fR[\fB\-\-rev \fIrevset\fR] [\fB\-v\fR]
Run the configured check command against a revision in a temporary
workspace without any queue processing.
Useful for verifying that the check command works before queuing items.
.PP
Defaults to the current working copy
.RB ( @ )
if
.B \-\-rev
is not specified.
.PP
With
.BR \-v " (" \-\-verbose ),
prints the workspace path, shell, and all environment variables before
running the check command.
Useful for diagnosing path or environment issues.
.PP
The temporary workspace is always cleaned up, regardless of outcome.
Exits 0 if the check passes; 1 if it fails.
.SS status \fR[\fIid\fR] [\fB\-\-json\fR] [\fB\-\-resolve \fIchange_id\fR]
Display the current queue state: queued items (ascending by sequence ID)
and recent failures (descending, up to
.BR max_failures ).
Each entry shows its sequence ID, change ID prefix, and first line of
the commit description.
.PP
Also indicates if a run lock is currently held (another
.B jjq run
is in progress).
.PP
With
.BR \-\-json ,
outputs structured JSON with
.BR running ,
.BR queue ,
and
.B failed
fields.
Queue items include
.BR change_id ,
.BR commit_id ,
and
.BR description .
Failed items include
.BR candidate_change_id ,
.BR candidate_commit_id ,
.BR description
(original candidate message),
.BR trunk_commit_id ,
.BR workspace_path ,
and
.BR failure_reason .
.PP
With a positional
.IR id ,
displays a single item's detail view (from either queue or failed).
With
.BR \-\-resolve ,
looks up an item by its candidate change ID.
.I id
and
.B \-\-resolve
are mutually exclusive.
.SS delete \fIid\fR
Remove an item from the queue or the failed list by its sequence ID.
The sequence ID is the number shown in
.B status
output and
.B push
confirmation messages.
.SS clean
Remove jjq workspaces left behind by failed merges.
Lists each workspace removed.
Safe to run at any time \(em only removes jjq\-owned workspaces, never
user workspaces.
.SS doctor
Validate that the jjq environment is correctly configured.
Checks the trunk bookmark, check command, lock state, and workspace
preconditions.
Each check is reported as
.BR ok ,
.BR WARN ,
or
.BR FAIL .
When a check fails, a suggested fix is shown.
.PP
Exits 0 if no failures are found (warnings are tolerated).
Exits 1 if any check fails.
.SS config \fR[\fIkey\fR [\fIvalue\fR]]
Get or set configuration.
With no arguments, displays all configuration values.
With one argument, displays that key's value.
With two arguments, sets the key to the given value.
.PP
Valid keys:
.TP
.BR trunk_bookmark " (default: \(lqmain\(rq)"
The bookmark that
.B jjq
treats as the protected trunk.
All merges target this bookmark.
.TP
.BR check_command " (required)"
Shell command to run in the merge workspace to validate a candidate.
Should run tests, lints, type checks, or whatever gates your trunk.
Exit 0 means pass; non\-zero means fail.
.IP
Set during
.B jjq init
or configured afterward with
.BR "jjq config" .
.TP
.BR max_failures " (default: 3)"
Number of recent failures shown by
.BR status .
.SH EXIT CODES
.TP
.B 0
Success.
.TP
.B 1
Merge conflict or check command failure.
.TP
.B 3
Lock held.
Another
.B jjq
process is running.
Retry later.
.TP
.B 10
Usage error.
Bad arguments, ambiguous revset, duplicate push of an amended revision,
etc.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.B jjq
stores configuration on an isolated metadata branch
.RB ( jjq/_/_ )
parented to the repository root.
This branch never appears in normal
.B jj log
output and does not pollute user history.
.PP
Always configure
.B check_command
before using
.BR "jjq run" .
The default check command rejects everything.
.SH LOCKING
.B jjq
uses flock\-based file locks in
.I .jj/jjq\-locks/
to coordinate concurrent access.
Locks are released automatically by the OS when the holding process
exits, so stale locks cannot occur.
.TP
.B id
Protects sequence ID allocation (brief, during push).
.TP
.B config
Protects configuration reads and writes.
.TP
.B run
Ensures only one
.B jjq run
processes the queue at a time.
.SH DATA MODEL
Queue items are jj bookmarks named
.BI jjq/queue/ NNNNNN
where
.I NNNNNN
is a zero\-padded sequence ID.
Failed items use
.BI jjq/failed/ NNNNNN .
The metadata branch at
.B jjq/_/_
stores the last allocated ID and all configuration.
.PP
Successful merges are ordinary jj commits with two parents (trunk and
candidate) and descriptions like \(lqSuccess: merge N\(rq.
Failed merges are preserved as conflicted commits with descriptions like
\(lqFailed: merge N (conflicts)\(rq.
.SH TYPICAL WORKFLOW
Initialize a project:
.PP
.RS
.nf
jjq init \-\-trunk main \-\-check "make test && make lint"
.fi
.RE
.PP
Developer queues work:
.PP
.RS
.nf
jjq push @
.fi
.RE
.PP
Process the queue:
.PP
.RS
.nf
jjq run          # one item
jjq run \-\-all    # drain the queue
.fi
.RE
.PP
Handle a failure:
.PP
.RS
.nf
jjq status                    # see what failed
jj rebase \-b <rev> \-o main    # rebase onto current trunk
\&... resolve conflicts ...
jjq push <rev>                # re\-queue
jjq run                       # retry
.fi
.RE
.PP
Clean up:
.PP
.RS
.nf
jjq clean
.fi
.RE
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.B jjq
must be run from within a jj repository.
It invokes
.B jj
as a subprocess and expects it to be on
.BR PATH .
.SH TIPS
Configure
.B jj log
to hide jjq metadata bookmarks:
.PP
.RS
.nf
jj config set \-\-repo \(aqrevset\-aliases."trunk()"\(aq \e
    \(aqmain | ancestors(main, 2)\(aq
.fi
.RE
.PP
The check command runs in a temporary workspace that has the merged
state of trunk + candidate.
Any command that works in a normal checkout works here.
.PP
Push is cheap.
If you're unsure whether your revision will conflict, just push it \(em
.B jjq
checks for conflicts up front and rejects the push immediately.
.PP
For parallel development with multiple agents or developers, use jj
workspaces.
Each workspace gets its own isolated working copy branched from trunk.
Push from each workspace independently and let
.B jjq
serialize the merges.
